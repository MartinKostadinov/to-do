# To-do application
**1. History of the project**

In the first version  it was planned to be focused, with 3 fixed  task categories HTML, CSS and JavaScript,  had only 2 functionalities to create and delete tasks .

Second version, it was no more focused on three  exact categories. The user  had the chance to create as many as he wants categories. For every element there was custom animation for creating or deleting.
Also when creating category there are few options to personalize the category. In this version everything  was static and the information was not saved.


* Add title
* Add title color
* Add category background
* Add  screen position - there are three screen positions(left, middle, right), this works only on devices with larger screens.

When Category is created  users can remove it or choose to create task.

* There 3 tasks counters-  total tasks counts, tasks to finish, finished tasks.

Task options:

* Checked - for when its ready;
* Edit - separate box is created to edit the task;
* Remove - removing the task for the selected category

 The functionality is the same, but now  everything is saved in array-  categories, which contains object with the information for every category, when it is created and changed. This is the next step for the full release.
